## Why Problem Discovery Matters

Before you start designing and building your solution, you must answer critical questions:
- **Who is affected?** Identify the target users or stakeholders.
- **What is the real challenge?** Uncover the underlying issues that often lie hidden beneath the surface.
- **Why does the problem exist?** Understand the context and factors contributing to the issue.
- **How are users coping now?** Examine current solutions or workarounds to spot gaps and opportunities.

A deep understanding of the problem ensures that your efforts are directed towards something that truly matters, setting you up for a successful sprint.

## Key Activities in Problem Discovery

### 1. Research & Data Gathering
- **Interviews & Surveys:** Engage with potential users, stakeholders, or experts to collect firsthand insights.
- **Observation:** Watch how users interact with existing solutions or their environment to identify pain points.
- **Secondary Research:** Explore online articles, reports, and case studies related to similar challenges.

### 2. Empathy Mapping
- **User Emotions:** Document how users feel when encountering the problem.
- **User Needs:** Identify unmet needs and expectations.
- **Pain Points:** List specific frustrations and challenges faced by users.

### 3. Trend & Competitive Analysis
- **Market Trends:** Analyze how current trends might be influencing the problem.
- **Competitive Landscape:** Investigate existing alternatives and their limitations to understand what can be improved.

## Practical Exercise: Mapping Your Problem

1. **Identify the Problem Area:** Begin by writing down a broad area where you suspect a challenge exists.
2. **Conduct Initial Research:** Use interviews, online research, and observations to gather initial data.
3. **Document Your Findings:** Create a chart, mind map, or simple list to record key insights, quotes, and observations.
4. **Create a Problem Map:** Visualize how different factors and user pain points interconnect. This map will serve as your reference throughout the sprint.

## Reflect and Iterate

The goal of problem discovery isn’t to find the perfect solution immediately—it’s about building a robust understanding of the issue at hand. Use your notes and insights as a reference to continually refine your understanding as you move to the next phase.

A well-discovered problem is the cornerstone of a successful sprint. By investing time here, you ensure that every step you take afterward is grounded in a genuine need, ultimately leading to a solution that resonates with your target audience.
